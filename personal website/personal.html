          <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
          <p>I went to Costa Rica for 2 weeks last summer through my school's Spanish Club. We traveled all over the country and it was a super fun
            trip as I went with my best friend and my Spanish teacher was really fun. We went zip lining, white water rafting, to a farm, the capital, and many more places.

          <h2>Bahamas</h2>
            <p> During spring break of my junior year of high school, my family and gradparents went to the Bahamas and stayed at an all inclusive resort. 
              I went swimming with sea turtles, saw some dolphins and tropical fish, and relaxed on the beach. Overall it was a really fun trip and I would love to go back!

            <h2>San Diego</h2>
            <p>
              Back in 2017 I went to California over Easter break with my mom to visit my friend and her family since they moved there a few years back.
              We got ice cream, went shopping at an outdoor mall and saw a Youtuber while there, and saw sea lions! I really want to go back to visit in the future.

            <h2>Minnesota</h2>
            <p>
              This past winter I went to stay in a cabin for a couple days up by the Canadian border. We stayed at a resort and I just chilled in the cabin, worked on a puzzle,
              ate food, watched movies, and walked around outside. It was a fun trip, but it took so long to get there that I probably would not go back.
